# warwick-browser

Android app for accessing University of Warwick module webpages and downloading resources in an organized manner.

Once a module has been added, associated webpages can be accessed through the app.
All resources downloaded in the app such as lecture slides will be downloaded to the appropriate folder in `Documents/WarwickBrowser/<Module Name>`.

The app also provides a view of this folder for each registered module, and sorts the files intelligently to ensure that lecture materials are ordered correctly.
